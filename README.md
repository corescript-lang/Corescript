# CorescriptC

TODO:
- [ ] Clean up code and make consistent
- [x] Seperate code into multiple folders/files
- [ ] Create CLI interface

This is a fully working Corescript interpreter written in C.  
It does not use any external libraries, Regex, or any advanced  
parsing tools.  

It is mostly unfinished, and now is set to run example/hello.core
