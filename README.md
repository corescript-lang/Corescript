The Corescript programming language, implemented in C99.  

[The Documentation](https://github.com/corescript-lang/docs)

This is the official implementation. The code is very bad,  
I wrote it when I hardly knew how to implement a parser and
wasn't very proficient with C.

## Compilation:
```
make
```
## Usage
```
